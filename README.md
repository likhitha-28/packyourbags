This is a simple(not entirely) Hotel Reservation System where users can easily book rooms, receive automatic email confirmations, and leave reviews after their stay. Hotel owners can manage reservations, update or delete bookings, and even manage guest reviews. Staff can assist with bookings and update reservation statuses. The system also allows users to update or cancel their own reservations, making it a complete and efficient tool for both guests and hotel management.

profiles : users, hotel , staff
options for users : book a room, payment (stripe), update or delete reservation, leave reviews for hotels where they have stayed etc
for hotel and staff : manage the booking reviews etc
